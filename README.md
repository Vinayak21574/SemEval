**Textual-Emotion-Cause-Pair-Extraction-in-Conversations**

Emotion plays a vital role in human conversations. Our task
is to predict the cause of a particular emotion in the
conversations. Conversation in a natural form is multimodal.
Multimodal is especially for discovering both emotions and
their cause. That is why two types of models are combined,
which would predict the emotion of the utterance and the
cause of the utterance.
